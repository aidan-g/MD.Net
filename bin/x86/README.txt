The binaries included in this project are of unknown origin. 
They're taken from a release of platinum-md: https://github.com/gavinbenda/platinum-md
The project mentions a fork of linux-minidisc which I assume is the source code: https://github.com/vuori/linux-minidisc/
There is some divergence from the official linux-minidisc repo, enhancements and such.

Thank you to everyone involved here.
